# Jay's Data Repo

This is a repository to store different datasets that I have hunted and scoured from the wild wastelands of the interwebs. I hope to someday store them in a nice CKAN repo, but for now, I am content with hosting them here. The folder structure might change over the course of time as I figure how I want to organize my raw data, code and finished files, so make sure you pull the latest version.

The list of datasets in here is described below:

## Indian National Family Health Survey Data, 2015-16, by district. 
  *Original Source*: http://rchiips.org/nfhs/MP.shtml
  *Notes*: Currently it contains the data for the state of Madhya Pradesh. I plan to either add more states or write a script to scrape       all states into one single file
