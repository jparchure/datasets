## Jay's Data Repo

This is a repository to store different datasets that I have hunted and scoured from the wild wastelands of the interwebs. Someday, I'd hope to store them in a nice CKAN repo, but for now, I am content with hosting them here. The folder structure might change over the course of time as I figure how I want to organize my raw data, code and finished files, so make sure you pull the latest version.
